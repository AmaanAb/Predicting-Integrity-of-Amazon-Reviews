It has been found in a recent study to be significantly better than all of the 18 currently used anti-biotics in the treatment of MRSA staph infections. The strong phenol anti-oxidants destroy pathogenic bacteria, viruses and yeasts. This super herb is very rich in anti-oxidant phytochemical flavonoids and phenolic acids. It is the third highest herb in oxygen radical absorbancy capacity (ORAC) with an impressive score of 200,129. The USDA ranks oregano's antioxidant capacity anywhere from 3 to 20 times higher than any other herb.<br /><br />You can see 2 bottles Oreganol P73 in my fridge.

Biotin is also used to treat hair loss (alopecia), and for people with premature gray hair due to low levels of biotin, it has helped combat graying hair.<br />2) Treatment of Candida: Some people use biotin to treat Candida because it is said to be able to prevent yeast from changing into its fungal form.<br />3) Fat Burner: Biotin is often promoted as a \"fat burner\" because one of the principle roles of biotin is to help with the metabolism of fats, proteins and carbs.<br />4) Reduce Blood Sugar: In some cases, doctors recommend biotin to help people with type 2 diabetes reduce their blood sugar.<br />5) Gene Replication: On a deeper level, biotin is integral for gene replication.<br />6) Blood Cells and Bone Marrow: Biotin also helps in the production of healthy blood cells and bone marrow.<br /><br />My hair was thinning from working at a very stressful job. It had gotten to the point where I couldn\\'t successfully make a ponytail. I decided to have a try. After using the Biotin for 3 months, I am happy to report stronger, thicker hair.

After about 2 days, it would not allow video to display constantly and just kept flashing between the warning message and the video about every 6 or 7 seconds. It was like one second of video followed by 6-7 seconds of warning message. It would do it over and over and got really annoying. I took it back to my installer, and they said it was installed correctly. I had no amps, or other stuff and my car does not need a radio module (older car here with no fancy computer stuff except for new pioneer radio). I agreed to an additional $30 removal to have the bypass bench tested and it did the same thing on the bench. The installer fed power to the blue and black wires, and connected an alarm led to the green wire. It did the same flashing on the bench it did in the car. For $20, i dont want to deal with the hassle of returning it, but it cost me more out of pocket and time to make it worth it. I do not know if the seller should be responsible for this, but i did lose out a lot of money due to their product so I am not sure if I should pursue it.

It really depends on the day and how much she's gotta go.<br /><br />They seem to hold well overnight- no leaks, but it's not as dry either. As a result, our poor little Lucy has got some diaper rash a few times. She's a screamer when she's got it bad. In those instances we use a heavy strength rash cream by bourdeaux butt paste brand: [[ASIN:B00BMIT1U4 All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste Diaper Rash Ointment + FREE Aveeno Baby Daily Moisture Lotion]]. It absorbs well so it's not left all messy and residue on the diaper when you put a fresh one on. Anything still there at the next change wipes right off her bottom with ease too.\",\n",

My best luck has been butt paste diaper cream ([[ASIN:B00BMIVQ3E All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste + FREE Baby Ganics Thick N' Kleen (Fragrance Free) Baby Wipes]]) because it seals up the sensitive skin and I can still re-diaper my girl right away without a lot of fuss.

Just a bit about myself, I am 5 foot 10 somewhat athletic and would consider myself a little above average in terms of my fitness level.<br />Fit Deck<br />Fit Deck has been around for a few years now. I would place them second behind Strength Stack 52 in terms of the quality of workout you can get with these. They have a ton of different decks like bodyweight and basketball and even tai chi, to be fair, I only purchased the bodyweight cards though. Like Workout Labs the exercises were still very basic and lacked the neat gaming component that Strength Stack provides. The owner is a former navy seal (from many years ago), which helps the product, but if you look at him, he has very little muscle tone, which gets me a bit weary.<br />About $16/deck, not very happy with these since they lack any benefit for someone of intermediate or advanced fitness level. If you are a beginner and have no knowledge of working out, you can get these cards, but again, no reason to buy them if Strength Stacks are in stock.<br />Strength Stack 52<br />In my opinion the best of the three workout card companies. From the design to the game play, these cards have some really neat features. Every card has a QR code. The code can be scanned with any Smartphone and a video of the exercise on the card will show me how to do the exercise. Each card is numbered and suited and even color coded by body type. The website has some cool games you can play with the cards, but my buddy and I made up a few of our own. The inventor of the cards, Sergeant Volkin is a military fitness expert and you can tell by looking at him.<br />The best feature of these cards is the exercises themselves. Both Fit Deck and Workout Labs have very basic exercises, Strength Stack has exercises that are dynamic and fun, some of which I have neverseen before.<br />About $16/deck, really great deal, these are the cards I still use months after my purchase.<br />Workout Labs<br />This is the worst of the three exercise cards available. The creator of the cards has no muscle tone, no background in fitness or extraordinary fitness level (to my knowledge) , these cards are purely a marketing play as the owner outright claims he is a designer only. The cards are very, very basic, appealing only to beginners. When I got my cards in the mail, I noticed they were of good quality and waterproof in case you drip sweat on them. But, I have yet to sweat using these cards.<br />PLEASE NOTE: The reviews on this product are fake. I have clicked on almost all of the 5 star reviews and everyone one of them have only reviewed this product. You can even tell they are fake by the way they are written, a bit too perfect. That got me wary of purchasing the cards in the first place, but I still did.<br />The cards are divided into a male and female deck, which is  odd since fitness is unisex. There was nothing to do when I got the cards besides flip a card and look at the illustrations. Given the fact that they were $25 for a single deck of cards, I was hoping for much, much more as there are only 40 basic exercises in the deck. All in all, very disappointed with these.<br /><br />I hope this review helped, I was not paid in any way to review any of these companies.',\n",

So over the past few months I have tried a few other products I found in GNC like Instaflex, and GNC's own Triflex and while I noticed a slight difference with each of them I just continued looking to find something that would help noticeably alleviate the pain. I hate taking aspirin and ibuprofen as they both have a tendency to upset my stomach, and like the fact that it is more natural. My running partner recommended this to me, and what I noticed was that it really helped with the pain. I wouldn't say that the relief came immediately, but over about a week I noticed that the pain in my joints was much less, and my joints began to have just a more &#34;smooth&#34; feeling while running. I don't know how else to describe it, but I just don't get that rough feeling I would usually get after a week of running.

The idea of a reverse love story, a woman falling in love with the man she married only after his death, married with the mystery/suspense, as well as the Victorian setting appealed to me very much.<br /><br />Alexander portrayed the romantic part of the romantic suspense in an elegant and intelligent manner. Through reading his journals, Emily is astounded to discover that the ordinary aristocrat she thought she had married harbored passionate love for her and was far more interesting than she knew. This made me question Emily\\'s intelligence and powers of observation, though. Was she so self-absorbed that she didn\\'t take the time to get to know the man she was going to spend the rest of her life with? The more she finds out about Phillip, the more regret grows until Emily falls in love with her dead husband and begins to truly mourn him. Rather than letting her heroine lionize Philip, without question, Alexander then begins to poke holes in his character and Emily\\'s idolatry of him. In keeping with Emily\\'s newfound interest in Greek antiquities and Greek literature, there is a long-running discourse throughout the book regarding who is the better hero, Achilles or Hector. Alexander uses this discourse in subtle comparison to Emily\\'s love for her dead husband - the man she never knew and built up in her mind as an incomparable demi-god (like Achilles) with her flawed (but alive) suitors (like Hector, a human who dares battle Achilles, protected by the gods, to protect his kingdom).<br /><br />I liked Alexander\\'s exploration of Emily\\'s liminal role in Victorian society as a widow, neither mother or wife or virgin bride-to-be. She comes to the realization that without a husband, yet with his fortune, she is basically a free woman, able to do as she pleases within or even out of society.<br /><br />Emily\\'s character, however, made no emotional connection with me. Other than being very beautiful, so much so that her dead husband\\'s secret nickname for her was Kallista (the most beautiful) and being an avid reader, she was not very interesting. I could not see why sophisticated Philip fell in love with her; however, Alexander shows that perhaps, like Emily falling in love with the dead Philip, Philip also fell in love with a figment of his own romantic imagination. He didn\\'t know her, but chose her for her beauty, as Paris chose Helen for hers.<br /><br />Emily develops, however, throughout the course of the story. Initially inspired by her husband\\'s interests, she develops interests of her own: Greek antiquities, learning ancient Greek, the epic poems. She also explores her newfound freedom as an independent woman of means.<br /><br />\"Dissatisfied, I put down the book, irritated that Philip was not there. I desperately wanted the chance to argue about these things with him. As I sat there, I slowly began to realize that my own opinions were quite different from those of my husband. Until then I had attributed all my interest in classical antiquity to Phillip and had assumed that his own studies would serve as an adequate guide for mine. I no longer felt driven to study as a way to know Phillip. I wanted to study because I loved the poetry, because the beauty of Greek sculpture moved me...\"<br /><br />The suspense part of the novel was lackluster and slow-moving. While I liked the discussion of Greek antiquities and details of the Impressionist art movement, I was never gripped with the fervent need to get to the bottom of whodonit. The sequels sound like they\\'re set in some amazing locales; however, I don\\'t believe I will be continuing this series.',\n",

However, in order for this book to make some sense, the author had to rework the plot into the plot of Ender's Game, though it was not intented to be in it from the start. For instance, Bean states that during the great battles on Eros, he had to know where every ship was in order to be able to take over if Ender collapsed. However, in Ender's Game, Ender clearly states that the one who had overcontrol over half the fleet was Alai, who was almsot as good as Ender, according to Ender himself. In order to solve this discrepency, the author had Bean state that his performance was reduced because he had to do his part in the battles and also udnerstand the overall strategy, which explains his mediocre performance. In my opinion, this was just the author making excuses.  Not a terrible book, just not a very good one, especially considering how good Ender's Game was.

I installed it in my attic, powered it up, then spent a LONG time trying to figure out why it had no effect at all on my phone's reception. Turns out T-Mobile 4G is on a different bandwidth, though you have no way of knowing that from the description of the product on Amazon's site. (T-Mobile's 2G does work with this product.) I purchased from ANTOnline (there are different sellers for this product, depending on when you happen to buy). ANTOnline refused to give me a return RMA until Amazon intervened, and even then they took out a 15% restocking fee, which was just theft. In the process of figuring out how this technology works I talked to T-Mobile, and they sent me a free booster that actually works with their 4G network. Having tried both (Wilson's on the 2G, TMobile's on 4G) I have to conclude that Wilson's technology is falling behind: T Mobile's product is wireless (between the antenna and unit) and it was easy to install.

       "  \"I purchased this product a little over 5 months ago and hardly noticed a difference... Some people that purchase weight loss items continue with their unhealthy lifestyle while using the product, but I did not. After losing a close family member to weight related issues last year, I decided to change my life for the better.<br /><br />I purchased Slim Fast after hearing great reviews from others online and in my community. I fully trusted their opinions and had high hopes for this product. I purchased it and hoped that within a few weeks, paired with an active lifestyle, that I would notice some sort of results. Two weeks passed, three, four and even six weeks later I hadn't even lost 5 pounds! If you have struggled with weight like I have, you can understand how frustrating this can be. After my experience, I really question the good reviews this product has, I have no idea how people believe this product works in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />So naturally, what did I do? I decided I had to find something else that worked. I wasn't going to let the failure of this product keep me from reaching my goal of losing 50 lbs. I searched and searched, did my due diligence and finally settled on a product that I believed gave me the best chance of reaching my goal.<br /><br />It has been three months and I have lost 42 pounds since giving up on Slim Fast and I don't regret it! I'm going to reach my goal well before the end of the month and I couldn't be happier! I have never felt so good and relieved in my life. I get emotional typing this because I struggled for so long trying so many different products to still be unhappy and overweight.<br /><br />If you have went through the same emotional toll I have and need something that will get you results you need, USE THIS PRODUCT -----> http://amzn.to/1kIihbC. It is available here on Amazon and will change your life, I promise.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed. I am a walking and living example of the fact that this product works and helped me through the hardest time of my life. I hope this helps at least a few people who have struggled with weight throughout their lives.\",\n",

The toy had a variety of shapes and contrasting colors sure to keep my child occupied for a while.  After a few weeks of playing with the toy, I realized my baby didn't have much interest in it anymore.  First of all, the toy requires more motor skills than most 6 month olds have.  The squeaky ball sometimes gets stuck and makes it hard to push the squeaker.  The toy is also real heavy, and I'm concerned it will fall on my child's face when she's lying down trying to play with it.  Her foot also gets stuck between the bars when she's really active. The paint on the caterpillar started coming off by the time she reached 8 months old.  It's okay to use if your child is actually interested in it and able to maneuver it. However, it seems that by the time your child is actually old enough to do the toy some justice, all interest in playing with it is gone.  As far as a teething toy is concerned, I would have rather invested in a rattler.\",\n",

       "  \"Interesting book. It is better than &#34;Predictably Irrational.&#34; Indeed, people are often irrational, but sometimes what appears to be rational is not. But even in this book, Ariely misses one of the obvious and major reasons people make SEEMINGLY irrational decisions, that are actually quite reasonable and rational from an individual perspective. Our government has increasingly alienated people from individual responsibility and from other citizens, and it has taken the risk out of making decisions.<br /><br />As long as they receive government benefits and hand-outs, most citizens will not look behind the &#34;wizard's curtain.&#34; Nevertheless, modern U.S. Government is unlike any before. Citizens can observe that government is now nothing more than an unsustainable Ponzi scheme. A broad tax base of new taxpayers is needed every year just to pay basic government expenses. Yet, each year, the tax base shrinks (population of taxpayers decreases) and government expenses rise. In the face of this disaster, has government made an all-out effort to cut expenses? Of course not. Government is raising taxes to dangerous and debilitating levels, borrowing huge amounts of money from foreigners, and INCREASING EXPENSES. Obama has quadrupled-down on failure, creating the largest deficit ever. If a private citizen or corporation ran its affairs in this manner, it would be criminally procescuted for fraud.<br /><br />Citizens have internalized the government's ongoing propaganda-of-irresponsibility, and they observe the government's example of irrationality and emotionalism. And now the People are behaving just like their government. This is what government &#34;nudging&#34; has created.<br /><br />For over 60 years now, citizens have been detached from the effects of their negative decisions, whether concerning lifestyle or the effects of bad financial choices. With a constant barrage of government-sponsored propaganda; emotionalism and group-politics have replaced rationality as the bases for decision-making. And modern U.S. government propaganda is the most effective in history, as it employs all the lessons learned and techniques of behavior manipulation from the disciplines of sociology, psychological warfare, and psychology over the past 100 years. There are ongoing propaganda programs promoting and encouraging government provided medical care, unemployment insurance, welfare and social security benefits, free monthly income even for young people, and the chance of filing a lawsuit or getting the government involved when investments go bad. The government conditions citizens to incorrectly believe that correlation is the same as causation; and that appearances and emotional intent are the same as results. The government's goal: promote reliance on government and avoidance of individual responsibility, thought and judgment. Why? To insure ease of public manipulation and the political power of certain groups. Obama oligarch, Cass Sunstein, refers to this conditioning, manipulation and control of citizens as &#34;nudging.&#34;<br /><br />For example, during the recent &#34;subprime mortgage crisis,&#34; which Ariely cites as an example of irrationality, all parties behaved rationally and reasonably, EXCEPT the supposedly rational U.S. Government. Homeowners who could not afford houses knew the government was guaranteeing the loans and, given their minimal down payments, they knew they had little to lose from foreclosure if they could not make payments. Thus, it made perfect sense from their perspective to risk buying homes they could not afford. Similarly, lenders knew the loans were government guaranteed, and the government was threatening lenders with lawsuits and fines if they did not make loans to unqualified buyers, so the lenders knew they had little risk in making imprudent loans. In fact, lenders faced greater risk from government harassment if they did NOT make imprudent loans. Investors in those loans also acted rationally. They understood, correctly, that the government would not allow homeowners, lenders and investors to lose billions or trillions of dollars on a program the government forced on the country. Thus, investors bought loans they knew would probably go into default, because, even if they received no payments from borrowers, the government would rescue financial institutions and investors, which it did. Finally, the only party that did not act rationally was the U.S. government. First, it &#34;incentivized&#34; imprudent economic activity by taking the risk from lenders, borrowers and investors. Then, to make matters much worse, it actually rewarded and has now promoted imprudent financial activity by rescuing all parties to the government created mortgage &#34;crisis.&#34;<br /><br />Over the past 60 years, governments have aggressively promoted irrational risk-taking (which is actually rational for the individual, since he risks nothing), which has spread to all areas of individual human endeavor. Citizens are increasingly losing their good judgment, since the world in which they live is a fiction created by the government, bearing no relation to the real world of finance, economics, and survival based on good decisions. Thus, contrary to Ariely's thesis, the forces of &#34;irrationality&#34; are not hidden. Irrationality is a necessary part of modern government. In fact, many of the programs created by the government have the irrational and exact opposite effect than the one intended. For example, the 1960s &#34;Great Society&#34; and &#34;War on Poverty,&#34; created more poverty. The War on Gun Ownership has resulted in more violence by criminals. The welfare system designed to help families, destroyed families, and created several generations of illegitimate children. Despite billions spent on education; Math, Science and intelligence testing scores are in decline. This is because foolish government bureaucrats and academics have confused correlation with causation. Education does not make people successful. Rather, successful, intelligent people are more likely to finish their education and continue on with their successful lives. It is a waste of money to try to over-educate an unintelligent individual, who should be directed to trade training. Instead, politicians tell us it is preferable students receive diluted, fake degrees. Amazingly, not only does the government not encourage the most intelligent and productive citizens to have children, but instead, the government now subsidizes and promotes the breeding of the least intelligent inhabitants of the country. Incredibly, in many cases, the people receiving these breeding subsidies are not even citizens! There is insufficient space here for a complete list of government irrationalities.<br /><br />It is enough to note that modern government employs techniques similar to the &#34;Cargo Cult&#34; islanders who, by using sympathetic magic, thought that creating the superficial appearances of a system (fake airport and planes), would bring material reward (delivery of cargo). Like modern politicians, the Cargo Cult confused correlation with causation. Citizens have learned the lessons of government irrationality and it has conditioned individual behavior. Many academics and intellectuals, such as Ariely, have lost sight of the fact that human beings are animals that respond in ways that are similar to organisms and other animals. That is, they seek the easiest path to satisfaction of needs and emotions, and avoid effort and thought whenever possible. This is particularly true of individuals subjected to prolonged government propaganda campaigns. Government cannot force one to be successful, but it can set up conditions promoting irrationality and failure, as the U.S. has done. The best antidote to predictable government irrationality is to place individuals back in touch with reality, that is, with the true effects of their decisions. Despite Ariely's faulty analysis, hedoes unwittingly show the many ways in which government directly and indirectly promotes irrationality.\",\n",

It has been found in a recent study to be significantly better than all of the 18 currently used anti-biotics in the treatment of MRSA staph infections. The strong phenol anti-oxidants destroy pathogenic bacteria, viruses and yeasts. This super herb is very rich in anti-oxidant phytochemical flavonoids and phenolic acids. It is the third highest herb in oxygen radical absorbancy capacity (ORAC) with an impressive score of 200,129. The USDA ranks oregano's antioxidant capacity anywhere from 3 to 20 times higher than any other herb.<br /><br />You can see 2 bottles Oreganol P73 in my fridge. Wowww ... this oregano oil is just the best, it works miraculously! I had discomfort and dryness in my throat, then I took a couple drops of this oil in a tablespoon of water and drank it. This oil healed and soothed my throat almost instantly, and feel great up to now.

Biotin is also used to treat hair loss (alopecia), and for people with premature gray hair due to low levels of biotin, it has helped combat graying hair.<br />2) Treatment of Candida: Some people use biotin to treat Candida because it is said to be able to prevent yeast from changing into its fungal form.<br />3) Fat Burner: Biotin is often promoted as a \"fat burner\" because one of the principle roles of biotin is to help with the metabolism of fats, proteins and carbs.<br />4) Reduce Blood Sugar: In some cases, doctors recommend biotin to help people with type 2 diabetes reduce their blood sugar.<br />5) Gene Replication: On a deeper level, biotin is integral for gene replication.<br />6) Blood Cells and Bone Marrow: Biotin also helps in the production of healthy blood cells and bone marrow.<br /><br />My hair was thinning from working at a very stressful job. It had gotten to the point where I couldn\\'t successfully make a ponytail. I decided to have a try. After using the Biotin for 3 months, I am happy to report stronger, thicker hair.

They're not all shaped the same, they don't all go to the bathroom the same. It takes patience to find the right diaper for your baby. Just because my friend prefers swaddlers doesn't mean I do too. The Pampers Baby Dry is a good fit for my child. She's pretty small and long. I've noticed my friends with fuller, thicker babies don't have as much good luck. But for me, this is a great, thin, super-absorbant diaper that works well. The price is a great value as well.<br /><br />Be aware though, no diaper will elimnate diaper rash! Despite how absorbant your diaper choice is, your baby will still at some point have diaper rash. My best luck has been butt paste diaper cream ([[ASIN:B00BMIVQ3E All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste + FREE Baby Ganics Thick N' Kleen (Fragrance Free) Baby Wipes]]) because it seals up the sensitive skin and I can still re-diaper my girl right away without a lot of fuss.

       " 'I am a collector of fitness products, there are three exercise cards on the market (Workout Labs, Strength Stack 52 and Fit Deck) and I will post a brief review of all three here. Just a bit about myself, I am 5 foot 10 somewhat athletic and would consider myself a little above average in terms of my fitness level.<br />Fit Deck<br />Fit Deck has been around for a few years now. I would place them second behind Strength Stack 52 in terms of the quality of workout you can get with these. They have a ton of different decks like bodyweight and basketball and even tai chi, to be fair, I only purchased the bodyweight cards though. Like Workout Labs the exercises were still very basic and lacked the neat gaming component that Strength Stack provides. The owner is a former navy seal (from many years ago), which helps the product, but if you look at him, he has very little muscle tone, which gets me a bit weary.<br />About $16/deck, not very happy with these since they lack any benefit for someone of intermediate or advanced fitness level. If you are a beginner and have no knowledge of working out, you can get these cards, but again, no reason to buy them if Strength Stacks are in stock.<br />Strength Stack 52<br />In my opinion the best of the three workout card companies. From the design to the game play, these cards have some really neat features. Every card has a QR code. The code can be scanned with any Smartphone and a video of the exercise on the card will show me how to do the exercise. Each card is numbered and suited and even color coded by body type. The website has some cool games you can play with the cards, but my buddy and I made up a few of our own. The inventor of the cards, Sergeant Volkin is a military fitness expert and you can tell by looking at him.<br />The best feature of these cards is the exercises themselves. Both Fit Deck and Workout Labs have very basic exercises, Strength Stack has exercises that are dynamic and fun, some of which I have neverseen before.<br />About $16/deck, really great deal, these are the cards I still use months after my purchase.<br />Workout Labs<br />This is the worst of the three exercise cards available. The creator of the cards has no muscle tone, no background in fitness or extraordinary fitness level (to my knowledge) , these cards are purely a marketing play as the owner outright claims he is a designer only. The cards are very, very basic, appealing only to beginners. When I got my cards in the mail, I noticed they were of good quality and waterproof in case you drip sweat on them. But, I have yet to sweat using these cards.<br />PLEASE NOTE: The reviews on this product are fake. I have clicked on almost all of the 5 star reviews and everyone one of them have only reviewed this product. You can even tell they are fake by the way they are written, a bit too perfect. That got me wary of purchasing the cards in the first place, but I still did.<br />The cards are divided into a male and female deck, which is  odd since fitness is unisex. There was nothing to do when I got the cards besides flip a card and look at the illustrations. Given the fact that they were $25 for a single deck of cards, I was hoping for much, much more as there are only 40 basic exercises in the deck. All in all, very disappointed with these.<br /><br />I hope this review helped, I was not paid in any way to review any of these companies.',\n",

So over the past few months I have tried a few other products I found in GNC like Instaflex, and GNC's own Triflex and while I noticed a slight difference with each of them I just continued looking to find something that would help noticeably alleviate the pain. I hate taking aspirin and ibuprofen as they both have a tendency to upset my stomach, and like the fact that it is more natural. My running partner recommended this to me, and what I noticed was that it really helped with the pain. I wouldn't say that the relief came immediately, but over about a week I noticed that the pain in my joints was much less, and my joints began to have just a more &#34;smooth&#34; feeling while running. I don't know how else to describe it, but I just don't get that rough feeling I would usually get after a week of running.

It's safe but it's multifaceted obviously so that makes it great for moms like me. Unless you're right on top of me you really can't tell it's beat up at all. It's great to know there's something I don't have to be embarrassed about if I forget to set it aside (we've all been there- puke on shirts...you know ladies) before we go out later or something along those lines.\",\n",

       " 'The premise of And Only to Deceive excited me enough to get a copy the very same day I first heard about it. The idea of a reverse love story, a woman falling in love with the man she married only after his death, married with the mystery/suspense, as well as the Victorian setting appealed to me very much.<br /><br />Alexander portrayed the romantic part of the romantic suspense in an elegant and intelligent manner. Through reading his journals, Emily is astounded to discover that the ordinary aristocrat she thought she had married harbored passionate love for her and was far more interesting than she knew. This made me question Emily\\'s intelligence and powers of observation, though. Was she so self-absorbed that she didn\\'t take the time to get to know the man she was going to spend the rest of her life with? The more she finds out about Phillip, the more regret grows until Emily falls in love with her dead husband and begins to truly mourn him. Rather than letting her heroine lionize Philip, without question, Alexander then begins to poke holes in his character and Emily\\'s idolatry of him. In keeping with Emily\\'s newfound interest in Greek antiquities and Greek literature, there is a long-running discourse throughout the book regarding who is the better hero, Achilles or Hector. Alexander uses this discourse in subtle comparison to Emily\\'s love for her dead husband - the man she never knew and built up in her mind as an incomparable demi-god (like Achilles) with her flawed (but alive) suitors (like Hector, a human who dares battle Achilles, protected by the gods, to protect his kingdom).<br /><br />I liked Alexander\\'s exploration of Emily\\'s liminal role in Victorian society as a widow, neither mother or wife or virgin bride-to-be. She comes to the realization that without a husband, yet with his fortune, she is basically a free woman, able to do as she pleases within or even out of society.<br /><br />Emily\\'s character, however, made no emotional connection with me. Other than being very beautiful, so much so that her dead husband\\'s secret nickname for her was Kallista (the most beautiful) and being an avid reader, she was not very interesting. I could not see why sophisticated Philip fell in love with her; however, Alexander shows that perhaps, like Emily falling in love with the dead Philip, Philip also fell in love with a figment of his own romantic imagination. He didn\\'t know her, but chose her for her beauty, as Paris chose Helen for hers.<br /><br />Emily develops, however, throughout the course of the story. Initially inspired by her husband\\'s interests, she develops interests of her own: Greek antiquities, learning ancient Greek, the epic poems. She also explores her newfound freedom as an independent woman of means.<br /><br />\"Dissatisfied, I put down the book, irritated that Philip was not there. I desperately wanted the chance to argue about these things with him. As I sat there, I slowly began to realize that my own opinions were quite different from those of my husband. Until then I had attributed all my interest in classical antiquity to Phillip and had assumed that his own studies would serve as an adequate guide for mine. I no longer felt driven to study as a way to know Phillip. I wanted to study because I loved the poetry, because the beauty of Greek sculpture moved me...\"<br /><br />The suspense part of the novel was lackluster and slow-moving. While I liked the discussion of Greek antiquities and details of the Impressionist art movement, I was never gripped with the fervent need to get to the bottom of whodonit. The sequels sound like they\\'re set in some amazing locales; however, I don\\'t believe I will be continuing this series.',\n",

       " \"Loved Ender's game. Probably one of the best book's I've read. So when I saw this in a store i thought - great, I could get to read on about Ender and his battles.  However, in order for this book to make some sense, the author had to rework the plot into the plot of Ender's Game, though it was not intented to be in it from the start. For instance, Bean states that during the great battles on Eros, he had to know where every ship was in order to be able to take over if Ender collapsed. However, in Ender's Game, Ender clearly states that the one who had overcontrol over half the fleet was Alai, who was almsot as good as Ender, according to Ender himself. In order to solve this discrepency, the author had Bean state that his performance was reduced because he had to do his part in the battles and also udnerstand the overall strategy, which explains his mediocre performance. In my opinion, this was just the author making excuses.  Not a terrible book, just not a very good one, especially considering how good Ender's Game was. The author would have madea far better job if he had written a book involving Bean five years after the events of Ender's Game, and not relive them from Bean's perspective.\",\n",

T-Mobile is a major cell phone company, and its network is not one of the exceptions listed. I installed it in my attic, powered it up, then spent a LONG time trying to figure out why it had no effect at all on my phone's reception. Turns out T-Mobile 4G is on a different bandwidth, though you have no way of knowing that from the description of the product on Amazon's site. (T-Mobile's 2G does work with this product.) I purchased from ANTOnline (there are different sellers for this product, depending on when you happen to buy). ANTOnline refused to give me a return RMA until Amazon intervened, and even then they took out a 15% restocking fee, which was just theft. In the process of figuring out how this technology works I talked to T-Mobile, and they sent me a free booster that actually works with their 4G network. Having tried both (Wilson's on the 2G, TMobile's on 4G) I have to conclude that Wilson's technology is falling behind: T Mobile's product is wireless (between the antenna and unit) and it was easy to install. Wilson's requires a cable between the two, and took hours to install.\",\n",

I fully trusted their opinions and had high hopes for this product. I purchased it and hoped that within a few weeks, paired with an active lifestyle, that I would notice some sort of results. Two weeks passed, three, four and even six weeks later I hadn't even lost 5 pounds! If you have struggled with weight like I have, you can understand how frustrating this can be. After my experience, I really question the good reviews this product has, I have no idea how people believe this product works in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />So naturally, what did I do? I decided I had to find something else that worked. I wasn't going to let the failure of this product keep me from reaching my goal of losing 50 lbs. I searched and searched, did my due diligence and finally settled on a product that I believed gave me the best chance of reaching my goal.<br /><br />It has been three months and I have lost 42 pounds since giving up on Slim Fast and I don't regret it! I'm going to reach my goal well before the end of the month and I couldn't be happier! I have never felt so good and relieved in my life.

The toy had a variety of shapes and contrasting colors sure to keep my child occupied for a while.  After a few weeks of playing with the toy, I realized my baby didn't have much interest in it anymore.  First of all, the toy requires more motor skills than most 6 month olds have.  The squeaky ball sometimes gets stuck and makes it hard to push the squeaker.  The toy is also real heavy, and I'm concerned it will fall on my child's face when she's lying down trying to play with it.  Her foot also gets stuck between the bars when she's really active. The paint on the caterpillar started coming off by the time she reached 8 months old.  It's okay to use if your child is actually interested in it and able to maneuver it. However, it seems that by the time your child is actually old enough to do the toy some justice, all interest in playing with it is gone.  As far as a teething toy is concerned, I would have rather invested in a rattler.\",\n",

       " \"Interesting book. It is better than &#34;Predictably Irrational.&#34; Indeed, people are often irrational, but sometimes what appears to be rational is not. But even in this book, Ariely misses one of the obvious and major reasons people make SEEMINGLY irrational decisions, that are actually quite reasonable and rational from an individual perspective. Our government has increasingly alienated people from individual responsibility and from other citizens, and it has taken the risk out of making decisions.<br /><br />As long as they receive government benefits and hand-outs, most citizens will not look behind the &#34;wizard's curtain.&#34; Nevertheless, modern U.S. Government is unlike any before. Citizens can observe that government is now nothing more than an unsustainable Ponzi scheme. A broad tax base of new taxpayers is needed every year just to pay basic government expenses. Yet, each year, the tax base shrinks (population of taxpayers decreases) and government expenses rise. In the face of this disaster, has government made an all-out effort to cut expenses? Of course not. Government is raising taxes to dangerous and debilitating levels, borrowing huge amounts of money from foreigners, and INCREASING EXPENSES. Obama has quadrupled-down on failure, creating the largest deficit ever. If a private citizen or corporation ran its affairs in this manner, it would be criminally procescuted for fraud.<br /><br />Citizens have internalized the government's ongoing propaganda-of-irresponsibility, and they observe the government's example of irrationality and emotionalism. And now the People are behaving just like their government. This is what government &#34;nudging&#34; has created.<br /><br />For over 60 years now, citizens have been detached from the effects of their negative decisions, whether concerning lifestyle or the effects of bad financial choices. With a constant barrage of government-sponsored propaganda; emotionalism and group-politics have replaced rationality as the bases for decision-making. And modern U.S. government propaganda is the most effective in history, as it employs all the lessons learned and techniques of behavior manipulation from the disciplines of sociology, psychological warfare, and psychology over the past 100 years. There are ongoing propaganda programs promoting and encouraging government provided medical care, unemployment insurance, welfare and social security benefits, free monthly income even for young people, and the chance of filing a lawsuit or getting the government involved when investments go bad. The government conditions citizens to incorrectly believe that correlation is the same as causation; and that appearances and emotional intent are the same as results. The government's goal: promote reliance on government and avoidance of individual responsibility, thought and judgment. Why? To insure ease of public manipulation and the political power of certain groups. Obama oligarch, Cass Sunstein, refers to this conditioning, manipulation and control of citizens as &#34;nudging.&#34;<br /><br />For example, during the recent &#34;subprime mortgage crisis,&#34; which Ariely cites as an example of irrationality, all parties behaved rationally and reasonably, EXCEPT the supposedly rational U.S. Government. Homeowners who could not afford houses knew the government was guaranteeing the loans and, given their minimal down payments, they knew they had little to lose from foreclosure if they could not make payments. Thus, it made perfect sense from their perspective to risk buying homes they could not afford. Similarly, lenders knew the loans were government guaranteed, and the government was threatening lenders with lawsuits and fines if they did not make loans to unqualified buyers, so the lenders knew they had little risk in making imprudent loans. In fact, lenders faced greater risk from government harassment if they did NOT make imprudent loans. Investors in those loans also acted rationally. They understood, correctly, that the government would not allow homeowners, lenders and investors to lose billions or trillions of dollars on a program the government forced on the country. Thus, investors bought loans they knew would probably go into default, because, even if they received no payments from borrowers, the government would rescue financial institutions and investors, which it did. Finally, the only party that did not act rationally was the U.S. government. First, it &#34;incentivized&#34; imprudent economic activity by taking the risk from lenders, borrowers and investors. Then, to make matters much worse, it actually rewarded and has now promoted imprudent financial activity by rescuing all parties to the government created mortgage &#34;crisis.&#34;<br /><br />Over the past 60 years, governments have aggressively promoted irrational risk-taking (which is actually rational for the individual, since he risks nothing), which has spread to all areas of individual human endeavor. Citizens are increasingly losing their good judgment, since the world in which they live is a fiction created by the government, bearing no relation to the real world of finance, economics, and survival based on good decisions. Thus, contrary to Ariely's thesis, the forces of &#34;irrationality&#34; are not hidden. Irrationality is a necessary part of modern government. In fact, many of the programs created by the government have the irrational and exact opposite effect than the one intended. For example, the 1960s &#34;Great Society&#34; and &#34;War on Poverty,&#34; created more poverty. The War on Gun Ownership has resulted in more violence by criminals. The welfare system designed to help families, destroyed families, and created several generations of illegitimate children. Despite billions spent on education; Math, Science and intelligence testing scores are in decline. This is because foolish government bureaucrats and academics have confused correlation with causation. Education does not make people successful. Rather, successful, intelligent people are more likely to finish their education and continue on with their successful lives. It is a waste of money to try to over-educate an unintelligent individual, who should be directed to trade training. Instead, politicians tell us it is preferable students receive diluted, fake degrees. Amazingly, not only does the government not encourage the most intelligent and productive citizens to have children, but instead, the government now subsidizes and promotes the breeding of the least intelligent inhabitants of the country. Incredibly, in many cases, the people receiving these breeding subsidies are not even citizens! There is insufficient space here for a complete list of government irrationalities.<br /><br />It is enough to note that modern government employs techniques similar to the &#34;Cargo Cult&#34; islanders who, by using sympathetic magic, thought that creating the superficial appearances of a system (fake airport and planes), would bring material reward (delivery of cargo). Like modern politicians, the Cargo Cult confused correlation with causation. Citizens have learned the lessons of government irrationality and it has conditioned individual behavior. Many academics and intellectuals, such as Ariely, have lost sight of the fact that human beings are animals that respond in ways that are similar to organisms and other animals. That is, they seek the easiest path to satisfaction of needs and emotions, and avoid effort and thought whenever possible. This is particularly true of individuals subjected to prolonged government propaganda campaigns. Government cannot force one to be successful, but it can set up conditions promoting irrationality and failure, as the U.S. has done. The best antidote to predictable government irrationality is to place individuals back in touch with reality, that is, with the true effects of their decisions. Despite Ariely's faulty analysis, hedoes unwittingly show the many ways in which government directly and indirectly promotes irrationality.\",\n",

No headaches, diarrhea or chest pains like other weight loss stuff make you have. Oh and I didn't have flatulence either.

I know that is crazy and it is my fault not the products.<br /><br />I think people should buy it and be patient with it. Even if it takes three months to lose all the weight it is worth it because you live longer when you lose the weight and are thin. Thin people don't get some diseases as often as fat people do. You don't get diabetes type II and you don't get high blood pressure as often.<br /><br />If people in your family have that stuff you need to be thin to not get it.
